## About Old Turkic Script

The Old Turkic script (also known as Orkhon-Yenisei script or Köktürkçe) is the alphabet used by the Göktürk and other early Turkic khanates during the 8th to 10th centuries. The script is derived from the Old Sogdian alphabet and was used to write the Old Turkic language.

The script is written from right to left and consists of 38 letters, many of which represent both consonants and vowels, depending on context.

## Note on Character Display

To properly display the Old Turkic characters, your system must have fonts that support the Unicode Old Turkic block (U+10C00 to U+10C4F). If the characters appear as boxes or placeholder symbols, you may need to install a font that supports these characters, such as Noto Sans Old Turkic.
